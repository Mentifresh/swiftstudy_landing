              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.<br />

the sources from which the personal information is collected;<br />
the purposes for which we use your information;<br />

The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.<br />
If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be "portable", i.e. delivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance — provided that this is technically feasible.
</p>
<p>
The right to request the deletion of your personal information<br />
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on SwiftStudy, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).<br />
If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal information to do so — provided that this is technically feasible and doesn't involve disproportionate effort.
</p>
<p>

This means that we will not discriminate against you, including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging you a different price, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.<br />
However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.<br />
To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.

<p>
How to exercise your rights<br />
To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.<br />
For us to respond to your request, it's necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:<br />
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;<br />
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<br />
We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.<br />
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.<br />
If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental authority.<br />
You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
</p>
<p>
How and when we are expected to handle your request<br />
We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.<br />
We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.<br />
Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.<br />
Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.<br />
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
